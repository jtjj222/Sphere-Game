# Sphere-Game
Incomplete platformer game using pseudo-planetary gravity, written using libgdx/box2d

This is not even close to being complete, I am just pushing my progress so far so that I don't loose it.

# Building:
Build using gradle like any other libgdx project. I personally like android studio as an ide, as it works well for the cross platform code, and is open source.

# Licence:
GPLv3+
